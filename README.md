# gta-car-ai, fully autonomous driving model

## Model v1.0
Data consists mainly highways, roads are empty and speed is stable value. Main goal for model is to keep car beetween lines, and turn when needed. Thats first implementation and dataset is fairly small.

Model performs ok. It clearly got some intuition about roadlines and can drive even curviest routes, but it's kinda wobbly and drives on the lines all the time.

## Model v2.0(work in progress..)
Much bigger model, trained on full images of road.
